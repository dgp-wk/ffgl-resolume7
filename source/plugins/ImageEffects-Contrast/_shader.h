		uniform sampler2D inputTexture;	// Effects Only. A texture of whatever it is this effect is attached to.

		uniform sampler2D textureDest;	// Mixers Only. Mixers get two textures that they can.. mix. A layer is basically a texture in this context.

	If you are using the ffglqs Plugin classes and not manually submitting your own shader for compilation, you may wany to breakpoint lines 257 (Vertex) and 285 (Fragment) in FFGLShader.cpp. 
	That's where you'll get glShader Compilation messages (errors). 
	
	You'll also be able to watch what gets submitted for compilation at lines 246 (Vertex) and 268 (Fragment).
